# odin-calculator

Project made for The Odin Project's https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator Foundations Capstone project/assignment. 

Known bugs:

1. There is no cap for user input on operand length. leading to visual bugs and potential calculation bugs with large enough numbers

2. Outside of guard clause for rounding decimals on result, there's no floating point accomodations.

3. It's ugly as sin. I'd rather not spend hours tinkering with the visuals of a nooby project when I can advance in the cirriculum and spend time on more meaningful projects. 

4. Not tested on multiple displays.

5. Generally not stress tested beyond being functional.
